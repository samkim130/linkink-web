tonight

tonight, through the night, into your eyes,
the whole of me
speak no words
just behold me
mmmmmmmm
promise you I'll only be yours

the nights I had it all, the nights I had none,
remember?
our calls through the night
had my heart ache
this moment's all I've ever dreamt of

the moon cycles back to its phase
just like how we'd end up talking again
how does the moon deal
with losing its pieces of light
maybe that's why
it keeps coming by

we'd always wonder if
that was our last
but how lucky were we to be wrong
promise you that'll never come true

do you know how much I
have longed for this to be routine
to finally call you solely mine
and for you to solely keep me

the moon empties out its whole heart
just to fill it up even fuller too
but how does it deal
with losing its pieces of light
I can never let
you away yet

we'd always wonder if
that was our last
but how lucky were we to be wrong
promise you that'll never come true

tonight, through the night, into your eyes,
the whole of me
speak no words
just behold me
mmmmmmmm
may this night forever last
